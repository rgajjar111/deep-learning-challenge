# deep-learning-challenge
## Overview of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model that predicts whether applicants for Alphabet Soup funding will be successful. We aim to create a model with an accuracy higher than 75% to effectively classify successful and unsuccessful applicants based on various input features.

## Results:
### Data Preprocessing:
#### Target Variable(s):
The target variable for our model is 'IS_SUCCESSFUL', which indicates whether the applicant received funding (1) or not (0).

#### Features for the Model:
Features used for the model include all columns in the dataset except 'IS_SUCCESSFUL', 'EIN', and 'NAME'. These columns were dropped as they do not provide relevant information for predicting the target variable.

#### Removed Variables:
The 'EIN' and 'NAME' columns were removed from the input data as they are neither targets nor features for our model.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
#### Model Architecture:
The model consists of three layers: two hidden layers with 80 and 30 neurons, respectively, and an output layer with one neuron using a sigmoid activation function.
The input layer has the same number of neurons as the number of input features.
#### Model Performance:
After training the model for 100 epochs, the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 72.51% on the test dataset. This accuracy did not meet the target of 75%.

### Summary:
The deep learning model achieved an accuracy of 72.51%, which is below the target accuracy of 75%. To improve model performance, several strategies can be explored:

#### Feature Engineering:
Further analyze and preprocess the input data to identify additional features or transformations that could improve the model's predictive power.

#### Model Architecture:
Experiment with different architectures by adding more neurons, hidden layers, or using different activation functions to increase the model's capacity to capture complex patterns in the data.

#### Training Regimen:
Increase the number of epochs or adjust the batch size during training to allow the model more time to converge to the optimal solution.

#### Hyperparameter Tuning:
Perform hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal combination of parameters that maximize model performance.
Considering the classification nature of the problem, alternative models such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, or Support Vector Machines could also be explored as they might provide better performance for this classification task, especially when dealing with non-linear relationships and complex interactions among features. Further experimentation and fine-tuning of the deep learning model or exploring alternative models can lead to improved predictive accuracy for identifying successful funding applicants.
